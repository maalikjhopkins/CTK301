      <h1>Rumor Mill</h1>
      <p class="specialp2">Rumor Mill is a high context, low maintenance card game that is inspired by Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples. It involves two evenly divided teams and some of the basics for making a sentence (noun, verb, time, place). The objective is to compete with your opponent from the opposite team to make the funniest sentence. The only catch is that everyone else will have their eyes closed while sentences are being made. Therefore, when the sentences are revealed and it's time to vote, they won't know which team made which sentence! One team wins when they reach a set number of round wins, which is agreed upon by each team before playing and at least equal to the number of players on each team so all players can make a sentence at least once.</p>
