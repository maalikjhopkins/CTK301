  			<p class="specialp2">Hi! My name is Maalik Hopkins and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Creative Technologies on the Game Design track at Illinois State University. I was introduced to videogames for the first time when I was in the second grade (I think I was 7 or 8 years old at the time). Ever since then, I have always had a love for playing videogames, mainly platformers (Mario, Sonic, etc.) and JRPGs (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, etc.). Towards the end of my senior year of high school, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to major in for college. My original plan was to go in undecided and figure it after my freshman year. I had always thought my major would end up being computer programming or something but that changed when I found out Illinois State had a Creative Technologies Major. When I looked into it a bit more and found out on of the tracks was for Game Design I thought to myself, "I love playing video games, so why not try my hand at making them?" That's how I got to where I am now.</p>
